        prompt = f"""Imagine you are an academic advisor for a {major} program at {university}. Your task is to create a detailed, semester-by-semester course schedule for a student majoring in {major}. The student has already taken the following courses: {courses_taken_str}.

Start directly with the first semester's course list. This schedule should span four years (eight semesters) and include all required courses for the major, as well as general education requirements and electives.

When creating this schedule, please consider the following: (if not applicable then create a generals schedule excluding the courses already taken and do not mention this to the user!)
1. Start with the foundational courses in the first year, such as introductory computer science classes, mathematics, and general education requirements.
2. Ensure that prerequisite courses are taken before more advanced courses in the same subject area.
3. Distribute the workload evenly across semesters, aiming for about 15-18 credit hours per semester.
4. Include core computer science courses such as data structures, algorithms, computer systems, and software engineering.
5. Incorporate mathematics courses required for the major, such as calculus and discrete mathematics.
6. Add in general education requirements like writing, social sciences, and humanities courses.
7. Include elective courses in computer science and related fields to allow for specialization.
8. If applicable, factor in any co-op or internship semesters.
9. Ensure that upper-level courses and capstone projects are scheduled in the later years.
10. Include any required courses in related fields, such as electrical engineering or statistics.
11. Consider including courses that fulfill multiple requirements simultaneously when possible.
12. Leave some flexibility in the later semesters for advanced electives or concentration courses.

Please provide a semester-by-semester breakdown, listing the courses for each term along with their credit hours. Also, include a brief explanation for why certain courses are placed in specific semesters.

Remember to balance the technical computer science courses with general education requirements and electives to create a well-rounded academic experience. The schedule should prepare the student for a career in computer science while also providing a broad-based education.

Start directly with the course list for Year 1, Semester 1 without any introductory text."""
